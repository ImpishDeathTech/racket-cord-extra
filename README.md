# Design Notes
[Official Notes](https://github.com/simmsb/racket-cord#design-notes)
The library is focused on only a couple things and doing those things properly:
1. Providing some ease of use facilities for interracting with the api

There is nearly no caching of state in the client, so any parts that do are
modifications.

The rationale can be found in this [commit message](https://github.com/simmsb/racket-cord/commit/64b8f1de97fccb01487571362e2b4bac749c3691)
And in the official git. So I decided to write some ease of use crap, mostly for myself.
